# 🎯 MILESTONE 3 — Next step: Turn this single-book script into a REUSABLE
#   FUNCTION that you can call for any book URL. Think of it like a template:
#
#       def scrape_one_book(url):  ******* i made these changes*******
#           page = requests.get(url)
#           ... extract all 10 fields ...
#           return { ... dictionary of results ... }
#
#   Then your Phase2 file can call this function for EVERY book it finds.
#   That's how you scale from 1 book → 1000 books without rewriting anything!
def scrape_one_book(url):
    page = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup (page.content, 'html.parser')

    product = soup.find(id="default")
    items = product.find_all(class_= 'col-sm-6 product_main')

    # 💡 STYLE NOTE: You're using a mix of naming styles.
    #   Python convention (PEP 8) says use snake_case for variables:
    #   - book_title instead of Book_Title
    #   - review_rating ✅ (already snake_case!)
    #   - image_url instead of Image_URL
    #   Not wrong, just inconsistent — pick one style and stick with it.
    #   It'll help a lot when you start building bigger scripts!

    # ***** okay i fixed the naming convention to snake_case. i will be consistent with it from now on.*****
    book_title=(items[0].find('h1').get_text())

    quantity_available=(items[0].find(class_= 'instock availability').text.strip())

    items[0] = product.find(class_= 'carousel')
    image=(items[0].find('img') ['src'])
    image_url= urljoin(url, image)

    #lines 49 to 63 were updated from the previous week. i removed the moments and added the base url variable to make it easier to reuse in the future when i scrape all the books. i can just call this variable instead of writing the url every time.

    items[0] = product.find(class_= 'breadcrumb')
    category=items[0].find_all('a')[2].text.strip()

    items[0] = product.find(class_= 'sub-header')
    product_description=(items[0].find_next('p').text.strip())

    info_table = product.find('table', class_='table-striped')
    table_data = {}
    for row in info_table.find_all('tr'):
        header = row.find('th').text.strip()
        value = row.find('td').text.strip()
        table_dataable_Data[header] = value

    universal_product_code = table_data.get ('UPC')
    price_including_tax = table_data.get ('Price (incl. tax)')
    price_excluding_tax = table_dataata.get ('Price (excl. tax)')

 # ❓ GREAT QUESTION: "Where does this URL come from when I scrape ALL books?"
 #   Right now you hardcoded it because you were testing with one book.
 #   When you move to the week milestone (scraping all 1,000 books), you'll get
 #   this URL from the LISTING PAGES instead. Here's how:
 #
 #   1. You fetch a listing page like:
 #        https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books_1/index.html
 #   2. You find all <article class="product_pod"> elements on that page
 #   3. Each one has a link: <h3><a href="../../a-light-in-the-attic_1000/index.html">
 #   4. You convert that relative href to an absolute URL, e.g.:
 #        "https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/a-light-in-the-attic_1000/index.html"
 #   5. THAT becomes the product_page_url for that book — and you pass it into
 #      your scraping function to get all the other fields.
 #
 #   So product_page_url won't be hardcoded anymore — it will be DYNAMIC,
 #   coming from each book's link on the listing page.
 #   TIP: Python's `urllib.parse.urljoin(base, relative)` can help convert
 #   relative URLs to absolute ones.
***** product_page_url = ('https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/set-me-free_988/index.html')***** # Im not sure if there still needs to be here
    
    return {
            'product_page_url': [product_page_url],
            'universal_product_code': [universal_product_code],
            'book_title': [book_title],
            'price_including_tax': [price_including_tax],
            'price_excluding_tax': [price_excluding_tax],
            'quantity_available': [quantity_available],
            'product_description': [product_description],
            'category': [category],
            'review_rating': [review_rating],
            'image_url': [image_url],
    }


# 🎯 MILESTONE 3 NOTE: When you scale to 1000 books, you DON'T want to create
#   a new DataFrame for each book. Instead, collect ALL book dictionaries into
#   one big list, then build ONE DataFrame at the very end:
#
#       all_books = []
#       for url in all_book_urls:
#           book_data = scrape_one_book(url)
#           all_books.append(book_data)
#       master_report = pd.DataFrame(all_books)
#       master_report.to_csv('all_books.csv', index=False)

# i incldued this on the phase2 file
#
#   This is much faster and cleaner than creating 1000 separate CSVs!
