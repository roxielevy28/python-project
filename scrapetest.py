# 🎯 MILESTONE 3 — Next step: Turn this single-book script into a REUSABLE
#   FUNCTION that you can call for any book URL. Think of it like a template:
#
#       def scrape_one_book(url):  ******* i made these changes*******
#           page = requests.get(url)
#           ... extract all 10 fields ...
#           return { ... dictionary of results ... }
#
#   Then your Phase2 file can call this function for EVERY book it finds.
#   That's how you scale from 1 book → 1000 books without rewriting anything!

# Roxanne: i removed the base url and the category url? should i have kept those or not since im making a resusable ink

    page = requests.get(url)

    items = product.find_all(class_= 'col-sm-6 product_main')

    book_title=(items[0].find('h1').get_text())
    quantity_available=(items[0].find(class_= 'instock availability').text.strip())

    book_rating=items[0].find(class_='star-rating')['class'][1]

        # variable instead of writing into my dictionary. Fix: use the actual variable name 'table_data'

    universal_product_code = table_data.get ('UPC')
    price_including_tax = table_data.get ('Price (incl. tax)')

 # ❓ GREAT QUESTION: "Where does this URL come from when I scrape ALL books?"
 #   Right now you hardcoded it because you were testing with one book.
 #   When you move to the week milestone (scraping all 1,000 books), you'll get
 #   this URL from the LISTING PAGES instead. Here's how:
 #
 #   1. You fetch a listing page like:
 #        https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books_1/index.html
 #   2. You find all <article class="product_pod"> elements on that page
 #   3. Each one has a link: <h3><a href="../../a-light-in-the-attic_1000/index.html">
 #   4. You convert that relative href to an absolute URL, e.g.:
 #        "https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/a-light-in-the-attic_1000/index.html"
 #   5. THAT becomes the product_page_url for that book — and you pass it into
 #      your scraping function to get all the other fields.
 #
 #   So product_page_url won't be hardcoded anymore — it will be DYNAMIC,
 #   coming from each book's link on the listing page.
 #   TIP: Python's `urllib.parse.urljoin(base, relative)` can help convert
 #   relative URLs to absolute ones.
    # Harold: (Milestone 2 fix + connects to Milestones 3 & 4) The old line had '*****' as pseudo-comment
    # markers (not valid Python syntax) and hardcoded ONE book's URL. That defeats the purpose of making
    # this a reusable function! Now that this function takes 'url' as a parameter, I should use THAT url.
    # When Phase2 (Milestone 3) or All_Catergory.py (Milestone 4) calls scrape_one_book(some_url),
    # 'some_url' is what gets passed in as 'url' here — and that's the product_page_url for that book.
    product_page_url = url

    return {
            # Harold: product_page_url now uses the 'url' parameter (Milestone 2 fix)
            'product_page_url': [product_page_url],
            # Harold: The remaining fields come from my extraction logic above (Milestone 2 original)
            'universal_product_code': [universal_product_code],
            'book_title': [book_title],
            'price_including_tax': [price_including_tax],
            'price_excluding_tax': [price_excluding_tax],
            'quantity_available': [quantity_available],
            'product_description': [product_description],
            'category': [category],
            'review_rating': [review_rating],
            'image_url': [image_url],
    }

# ********I belive i added all the changes to make this a reusable function********
# 🎯 MILESTONE 3 NOTE: When you scale to 1000 books, you DON'T want to create
#   a new DataFrame for each book. Instead, collect ALL book dictionaries into
#   one big list, then build ONE DataFrame at the very end:
